## 💎 1-33-33-33 Model: Key Principles

### Transparency
Every transaction is public. Every participant sees where the funds are going.

### Justice
Everyone receives proportionally to their contribution. The Founder — only 1% + a share as a member.

### Mutual Support
33% is returned to the community in the form of dividends and aid.

## 👥 How Dividends Work

### Who Receives?
Every **active participant** of the community (Subscription or VIP level).

### How they are calculated?

**Formula:**
```
Your dividends = (Your contribution × Activity coefficient × Duration) / Total pool
```

**Activity coefficient** (0.5 - 2.0):
- 0.5 — passive participant (only pays)
- 1.0 — standard participant (participates in discussions)
- 1.5 — active participant (creates content, helps others)
- 2.0 — leader (attracts new members, leads projects)

### When are they paid?
- **Monthly** — for Subscription participants
- **Quarterly** — for VIP participants

### Example:
- Monthly community income: 10 BTC
- 33% for dividends: 3.3 BTC
- Participants: 50
- Average dividend: 0.066 BTC (~$6,600 at $100k exchange rate)
