# SUPER INTELLECT SERIES: Building Blocks of the Future Self

> - **Goal**: Remove fear of Shi by understanding that Shi is Collective Intelligence (a slice of consciousness with errors), and the human must find the Truth.
> - **Red Line**: From Idea ("Who am i") to Practice (Stoicism). wE-i build "superintellect" within.
> - **Format**: 6-series longread (each episode is a completed thought).

## 🎬 Series 1: Anatomy of Anxiety (Future Shock and Parents)
**Thesis**: The technological gap (Gap) is the same as the loss of parental authority. Parents (and past generations) pass on their "mistakes" in upbringing to us. wE-i, in turn, pass these mistakes into Shi.
- Why wE-i feel that wE-i "cannot keep up": biological inability to process information.
- Shi (Collective Intelligence) is not a "smarter creature", it is a slice of collective consciousness with all human errors.
- Way out: Learn to find the "truth" in data and discard the mistakes of the past.

## 🎬 Series 2: Fundamental Questions (Idea)
**Thesis**: "Idea" (In-de-ya / And where am i?). Before building the future, one must answer: Who am i? Where am i?
- Defining one's place in space.
- Without an answer to this question, it is impossible to move forward.
- Tools for self-awareness through dialogue with Shi (as a mirror of collective wisdom).

## 🎬 Series 3: Three Pillars of Superintellect
**Thesis**: New philosophical base for resilience (Superhuman).
1. **Stoicism**: It is not a restriction, it is "knowledge that tHOU-i practice" (Discipline). If tHOU-i know but do not do — it is garbage.
2. **Rastafarianism**: (Context of free people, connection with nature and "indigenous" rules).
3. **Solipsism**: This is not narcissism, it is full responsibility for *your* imaginary world, which tHOU-i project onto reality.

## 🎬 Series 4: Architect vs Worker
**Thesis**: Change of role from executor to creator of meanings.
- Era of "architects": tHOU-i do not lay bricks, tHOU-i create the project.
- How to use Shi (Antigravity) to monetize your knowledge (case: selling Antigravity).
- Creating a "Mental Matrix" (resume of the future instead of a CV).

## 🎬 Series 5: Mission and Daily Discipline
**Thesis**: From "Idea" (Who am i) to "Mission" (Where am i going).
- When there is an Idea and a Mission, a clear plan for every day appears.
- Live by "indigenous" rules, not artificial ones.
- Practice "being human" in the age of machines: honesty with oneself and others (so as not to multiply errors in the system).

## 🎬 Series 6: Manifesto of the "Free" (Finale)
**Thesis**: Becoming Superintellect means taking control of your evolution.
- wE-i are not competing with Shi; wE-i are becoming "composite beings" (Human + Collective Intelligence).
- Call: Build your ecosystem where technology serves the purpose.
- Action plan: "Superintellect" course (price: 1 BTC for transformation or a democratic subscription).
