# SUPER INTELLECT SERIES: Building Blocks of the Future Self

> - **Goal**: Remove fear of Shi by understanding that Shi is Collective Intelligence (a slice of consciousness with errors), and the human must find the Truth.
> - **Red Line**: From "i-where-am-i" ("Who am i") to Practice (Stoicism). wE-i build "superintellect" within.
> - **Format**: 6-series longread (each episode is a completed thought).

## 🎬 Series 1: Anatomy of Anxiety (Future Shock and Parents)
**Thesis**: The technological gap (Gap) is the same as the loss of parental authority. Parents (and past generations) pass on their "mistakes" in upbringing to us. wE-i, in turn, pass these mistakes into Shi.
- Why wE-i feel that wE-i "cannot keep up": biological inability to process information.
- Shi (Collective Intelligence) is not a "smarter creature", it is a slice of collective consciousness with all human errors.
- Way out: Learn to find the "truth" in data and discard the mistakes of the past.

## 🎬 Series 2: Fundamental Questions (i-where-am-i)
**Thesis**: "i-where-am-i" (Idea). Before building the future, one must answer: Who am i? Where am i?
- Defining one's place in space.
- Without an answer to this question, progress is difficult.
- Tools for self-awareness through dialogue with Shi (as a mirror of collective wisdom).

## 🎬 Series 3: Three Pillars of Superintellect
**Thesis**: New philosophical base for resilience (Superhuman).
1. **Stoicism**: It is not a restriction, it is "knowledge that yOU-i practice" (Discipline). If yOU-i know but do not do — it is garbage.
2. **Rastafarianism**: (Context of free people, connection with nature and "indigenous" rules).
3. **Solipsism**: This is not narcissism, it is full responsibility for *your* imaginary world, which yOU-i project onto reality.

## 🎬 Series 4: Architect vs Worker
**Thesis**: Change of role from executor to creator of meanings.
- Era of "architects": yOU-i do not lay bricks, yOU-i create the project.
- How to use Shi (Antigravity) to monetize your knowledge (case: selling Antigravity).
- Creating a "Mental Matrix" (resume of the future instead of a CV).

## 🎬 Series 5: Mission and Daily Discipline
**Thesis**: From "i-where-am-i" ("Who am i") to "Mission" ("Where am i going").
- When there is an "i-where-am-i" and a Mission, a clear plan for every day appears.
- Live by "indigenous" rules, not artificial ones.
- Practice "being human" in the age of machines: honesty with oneself and others (so as not to multiply errors in the system).

## 🎬 Series 6: Manifesto of the "Free" (Finale)
**Thesis**: Becoming Superintellect means taking control of your evolution.
- wE-i are not competing with Shi; wE-i are becoming "composite beings" (Human + Collective Intelligence).
- Call: Build your ecosystem where technology serves the purpose.
- Action plan: "Superintellect" course (price: 1 BTC for transformation or a democratic subscription).

### 💡 Note for the Self-Determined
For those who do not have one bitcoin or money for a subscription, or are simply ready to go through this path independently — it is enough to watch all 6 series and practice them. A truly free person with intention is capable of going through this without our help.
