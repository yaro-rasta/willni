> "Our goal is to turn a crowd of executors into a community of Architects of Reality."

---

## 🏛️ VIP Transformation: "Architect" Level
**Price**: 1 BTC (50% upfront).
**Format**: 6-8 personal sessions (1 hour each).

### Stage 1: "In-de-ya / Idea" (Subjectivity Audit)
*   **Goal**: Determine point zero. Who am i? Where am i?
*   **Actions**: Deep analysis of the current "Mental Matrix", identifying inherited errors from parents and society. Defining the "Collective Intelligence" that currently globalizes your decisions.

### Stage 2: "Shadows and Mirrors" (Clearing the Field)
*   **Goal**: Neutralization of external pressure.
*   **Actions**: Work with "shadows" (fears, debts, state pressure). Turning them into "mirrors" for self-learning. Realization that any enemy is only a reflection of internal unreadiness to be Free.

### Stage 3: "Three Pillars" (Base Integration)
*   **Goal**: Formation of the philosophical foundation.
*   **Actions**: Practical implementation of Stoicism (discipline of daily knowledge), Rastafarianism (living by indigenous rules), and Solipsism (responsibility for one's imaginary world).

### Stage 4: "Designing the Matrix" (Mind Architecture)
*   **Goal**: Creation of a personal language and logical model.
*   **Actions**: Formation of one's own "Language Code", development of truth filters based on the 4 laws of logic. Creating a "Mental Matrix" that replaces any resume.

### Stage 5: "Hyper-Speed" (Antigravity Toolkit)
*   **Goal**: Converting thought into results at a speed of 1 BTC/day.
*   **Actions**: Setting up a personal Shi ecosystem (Antigravity). Training in "prompt-architecture": how to manage Shi so that it multiplies your idea by the experience of millions without losing your subjectivity.

### Stage 6: "Manifesto of Sovereignty" (Consolidation)
*   **Goal**: Transition to autonomous management of reality.
*   **Actions**: Drawing up a daily "Mission" plan. Final check for the "purity" of the matrix. A person becomes capable of surviving and thriving even in the cold without clothes (activation of superpowers through full trust in the Universe).

## 👥 Scheme for IT Teams and C-Level (Corporate Transformation)
**Price**: > 1 BTC (depending on team size).
**Goal**: Creation of a "Collective Subject" (a team of Architects).

### 1. Role Transformation: From Executors to Architects
*   The team stops "laying bricks" (writing code without meaning).
*   Transition to designing systems where 80% of the work is done by Shi under the supervision of team architects.

### 2. Common Mental Matrix of the Project
*   Creation of a single "Language Code" for the team.
*   Implementation of the 4 laws of logic as a quality standard for internal communication.

### 3. "Free Humans" Humanitarian Fund
*   Part of the profit from corporate orders goes to the internal fund of the community.
*   **Fund goals**: Supporting participants in difficult situations, assisting in the defense of Ukraine (fighting total genocide), developing "Free" technologies.

### 4. Time Saving and Speed
*   The goal for the team is to reach an efficiency level where 1 working hour of the team brings value equivalent to market standards for a week.

## 💰 Energy Distribution (Finance)
*   **50% Prepayment**: Fixation of intention and trust.
*   **Cryptocurrency**: The only way to financial subjectivity.
*   **Social contract**: Each participant of the VIP transformation or team becomes part of the ecosystem where the success of one strengthens the whole community through humanitarian and technological contributions.
