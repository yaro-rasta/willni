## 🎯 Distribution of Revenues: 1-33-33-33

**Every hryvnia, dollar, or satoshi is distributed transparently:**

| Share | Purpose | Description |
|--------|-------------|------|
| **1%** | Founder | Fixed reward for creating and supporting the system |
| **33%** | "Free" Community | Dividends to participants proportional to their contribution |
| **33%** | Humanitarian Projects | Protection of Ukraine, fight against tyranny, support for political prisoners |
| **33%** | Development Fund | Technology, infrastructure, hostels, restaurants |

---

## 💡 Why such a model?

### 1% to the Founder — Service, not enrichment

The founder receives a minimal fixed share. But he is also a **member of the community** and receives dividends from the 33% just like every other participant.

**This means:**
- The founder is interested in the growth of the community
- No conflict of interest "founder vs participants"
- The project requires 1-2 days a week, the rest of the time — for other projects

### 33% to the Community — tHOU-i-i invest → tHOU-i-i receive

**How it works:**
1. tHOU-i-i join the community (subscription or VIP)
2. Your contribution is recorded
3. Monthly/quarterly tHOU-i-i receive a share of 33% proportional to:
   - Your financial contribution
   - Your activity (content, helping others)
   - Duration of membership

**This is not just a course — it's an investment:**
- tHOU-i-i receive transformation (value)
- tHOU-i-i receive dividends (financial security)
- tHOU-i-i receive help in difficult situations (mutual support)

### 33% Humanitarian — Our Tribute

Instead of 75% taxes to a state that does not perform its function, wE-i-i pay **33% for what is truly important:**
- 🇺🇦 Protection of Ukraine (the front line of the struggle against tyranny)
- ⛓️ Support for political prisoners around the world
- 🌍 The fight against genocide and oppression

### 33% Development Fund — Infrastructure of the Free

**Where the funds go:**
- 🛠 **Technology**: Antigravity, "Vільні" token, IPFS infrastructure
- 🏠 **Hostels**: Free housing for community members
- 🍽 **Restaurants**: Places where the Free can eat
- 💻 **Operations**: Servers, domains, platform support

## 🔄 Calculation Example

**Scenario**: Annual community income = 100 BTC

| Share | Amount | Purpose |
|--------|------|-------------|
| 1% | 1 BTC | Founder |
| 33% | 33 BTC | Dividends to participants |
| 33% | 33 BTC | Humanitarian projects |
| 33% | 33 BTC | Development fund |

**If there are 100 active participants in the community:**
- Average dividend = 0.33 BTC/year per participant
- Founder (as a community member) additionally receives his share from 33%

---

## 🛡 Cryptocurrency — Financial Sovereignty

State institutions block the accounts of free people. Therefore wE-i-i use:
- **BTC** — the main currency for VIP and large transactions
- **"Vільні" Token** — internal currency for small operations
- **IPFS** — decentralized storage for all documents

**This is not an escape from responsibility — it is the construction of a better system.**
