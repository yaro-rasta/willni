# Governance System: Council of the Free

> "Power and responsibility belong to those who invest in the development of the system and lead others."

---

## 🏛 Idea: Decentralized Governance

All decisions regarding **humanitarian projects (33%)** and the **development fund (33%)** are made by voting of the **Council of the Free**. Voting weight depends on the level of participation and responsibility in the system.

## 📊 Vote Weight

wE-i use a weighted voting system where contributions (financial or mentoring) give more influence on the development of the ecosystem.

| Level | Vote Weight | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Free** | 0 | Viewing and learning without participation in governance |
| **Subscription** | 1 | Active community participants |
| **VIP** | **9** | Investor participants who have undergone full transformation |
| **Mentor** | **12** | Those who take responsibility for the transformation of others |
| **Founder** | **12** | The first mentor and architect of the system |

## ⚡ Decision-Making Process

1. **Initiation**: Any participant (Subscription+) submits a request.
2. **Publication**: The request appears in the system (Revolt/Signal/GitHub).
3. **Discussion**: A short period of exchange of views (for urgent ones — parallel with voting).
4. **Validation**: Check for quorum (among VIP and Mentors).
5. **Execution**: Automatic transfer of funds from the appropriate smart contract or fund wallet.

## 🛡 Protection Against Abuse

1. **Principal Quorum**: A decision cannot be made without the participation of those who carry the most risks (VIP) and perform the most work (Mentors).
2. **Budget Transparency**: Each request contains a link to the transaction and a clear justification.
3. **Mentor Reputation**: If a mentor initiates fake requests, they can be deprived of their status (12 votes → 1 vote) by decision of Master mentors.

## 🪙 Technical Platform

- **Phase 1 (Beta)**: Voting via GitHub Discussions with manual counting of weighted votes.
- **Phase 2 (DAO)**: Use of Snapshot or a similar platform where voting weight is tied to status in the system (via token or NFT certificate).

**The Council of the Free is a mechanism where everyone's voice has weight and decisions have speed.**
