# Mentorship System: Train the Trainer

> "The best way to consolidate knowledge is to teach another."

## 🎓 Idea: Graduates = Mentors

After completing the VIP Transformation, a participant can become a **Mentor** — leading new participants through the same 6 stages.

### Why it works:

1. **For yOU-i-i (Founder):**
   - Scaling without your time
   - 1-2 days/week = strategy, not operations
   - More participants → more dividends

2. **For the Mentor:**
   - Additional dividends for mentoring
   - Consolidation of their own transformation
   - Status in the community

3. **For the New Participant:**
   - Personal guidance
   - Real transformation experience (not theory)
   - More affordable price

## 📊 Distribution Model for Mentors

When a Mentor leads a VIP participant (1 BTC):

| Share | Who | Description |
|--------|------|------|
| **1%** | Founder | Standard share |
| **33%** | Community | Dividends to everyone |
| **33%** | Humanitarian | Standard tribute |
| **33%** | Development Fund | But from it... |

**From the Development Fund (33%), the Mentor receives:**

| Mentor Type | Share of the Fund | Description |
|----------------|------------------|------|
| **Junior Mentor** | 30% (≈10% of total) | First 1-3 participants |
| **Senior Mentor** | 50% (≈16% of total) | 4-10 participants |
| **Master Mentor** | 70% (≈23% of total) | 10+ participants |

## 💰 Calculation Example

**Scenario**: A Mentor leads 5 VIP participants per year (5 BTC)

| Share | Amount | Who |
|--------|------|------|
| 1% | 0.05 BTC | Founder |
| 33% | 1.65 BTC | Community (dividends) |
| 33% | 1.65 BTC | Humanitarian |
| 33% | 1.65 BTC | Development Fund |

**From the Development Fund, the Mentor receives:**
- Senior (50%): 0.825 BTC
- Remainder for infrastructure: 0.825 BTC

**Mentor's Total Income:**
- Directly: 0.825 BTC (for mentoring)
- Plus: share from the 33% dividends (as a community member)

## 🎯 Quality Control

### How to Ensure the Quality of Mentors?

1. **Certification**
   - Methodology test
   - Practical exam (leading a demo session)
   - Signing the code of ethics

2. **Feedback**
   - Each participant rates the Mentor (1-5)
   - Anonymous feedback after each stage
   - Quarterly review

3. **De-certification**
   - If the rating falls below 4.0
   - If the code of ethics is violated
   - Resolved by community vote

## 🔗 Connection with the 1-33-33-33 Model

The Mentorship Model **does not change** the basic distribution:
- 1% → Founder (always)
- 33% → Community (including Mentors)
- 33% → Humanitarian (always)
- 33% → Fund (from which Mentors receive a share)

**Mentors receive from the Fund, not additionally.**
