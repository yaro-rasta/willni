## 🎯 Key Concepts

### How it works?
1. **Collective Intelligence** (LLM/Shi) — it's not a "smarter creature", but a slice of humanity's consciousness with all the errors.
2. **Mental Matrix** — a personal knowledge base that filters Truth through the 4 laws of logic.
3. **Natural Law** — the foundation that stands above any state.

### Monetization
- **Level 1 (Free)**: Public series — charity for everyone.
- **Level 2 ($50-100/mo)**: Private community for practice.
- **Level 3 (1 BTC)**: VIP transformation or corporate transformation of teams.

### Financial Distribution
- **33%** → Internal Community Fund (infrastructure: restaurants, hostels).
- **10%** → Tithe for humanitarian needs and protection of freedom.
- **The rest** → Development of technology (Antigravity, "Vільні" token).

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Content**: Write a pilot article (Series 2: "Idea").
2. **Technology**: 
   - Create a landing page on `petteri.fi`.
   - Set up crypto payments (BTC).
   - Prepare "Vільні" token and ICO.
3. **Publicity**: Distribute [LAW.md](./LAW.md) through international organizations (UN, Council of Europe).
4. **IPFS**: Save all key documents in decentralized protocols for eternal storage.
