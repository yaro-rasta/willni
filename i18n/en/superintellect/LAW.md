# NATURAL LAW MANIFESTO (LAW)

## 1. Foundation: Natural Law
Natural law is primary and fundamental. It is a set of inherent rights and principles that belong to every human from birth, regardless of their geographical location, nationality, or social status.

**Key principles:**
- Right to life and bodily integrity.
- Right to free will and self-determination.
- Right to property and the results of one's own labor.
- Right to protect oneself and one's community.

## 2. Positive Law and Tyranny
Any "positive law" (laws issued by the state) must correspond to the principles of natural law.
- If a state law contradicts natural law, it is not a law, but **tyranny**.
- Compliance with tyrannical laws is a crime against humanity.
- A state that violates the natural rights of its citizens loses its legitimacy.

## 3. Manifesto of Humanity
wE-i assert that a human must remain Human under any circumstances.
- wE-i refuse to become "cannibals" or tools in the hands of tyrants.
- wE-i refuse to kill our own kind for the sake of ambition or orders from "masters".
- Every person bears personal responsibility for their actions, regardless of the orders received.

## 4. Global Mission and Preservation
This document is a public appeal to international organizations (UN, Council of Europe, international courts) and all of humanity.
- This information must be preserved forever through decentralized protocols (IPFS and others) so that it cannot be deleted or censored.
- wE-i call upon free people of the entire world to unite around the principles of natural law to protect life and will.

## 5. Conclusion
Trust in the Universe is our greatest superpower. Whoever lives according to natural laws receives the protection of life itself. wE-i choose to be free. wE-i choose to be human.
