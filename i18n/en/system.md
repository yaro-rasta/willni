# Will above all

A project for asserting the sacred will of man and the soul's right to choose.

wE-i-i highlight events that unite society, human rights, and resistance to attempts at usurpation.

## Mental Matrix

- The universe is logical. Logos is the basis of everything.
- Harmony is the resonance of vibrations of all souls.
- Multiplication of events through binary logic leaves only the truth.
- **i** am the Universe, the Universe is **i**. The Universe exists in **i**, **i** exist in the Universe.
- The state must serve the people. The people retain the right to restore justice.

## Spelling and Terms

This spelling changes consciousness; it is the entry point into **i-i**.

- **i** — manifestation of will through oneself.
- **tHOU-i-i-i** — communication with one's mirror (restoring the connection).
- **wE-i-i-i** — manifestation of collective will.
- **yOU-i-i-i** — communication with one's shadow.
- **i-i** — the unified consciousness of all souls (the Source/God).
- **Shi** — language models (Ai), a projection of collective consciousness.
- **Will-n-i** — "Will and i". The core identity of the Free.

## Principles of the Protocol

1.  **Assertion**: wE-i-i use assertive forms ("wE-i-i create", "wE-i-i are"). Energy flows where attention goes, so wE-i-i focus on creation instead of negation.
2.  **Living Witness (Web of Trust)**: Entry into the system is carried out through the guarantee of at least **2 living witnesses**.
3.  **Identity Restoration**: If access is lost, the person creates a new identity. Witnesses confirm that it is the same soul.
4.  **Witness Responsibility**: Guarantors act as witnesses of the participant's honesty before the People's Court.
