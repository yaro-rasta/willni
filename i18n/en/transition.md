# Transition: From System Serf to Will-n-i

This document describes the path to restoring human sovereignty.

## Current State: Human in the System
In centralized systems, a person often finds themselves in the state of:
- A system resource.
- Part of state property (through individual registration).
- An object of management.

## Target State: Free Living Human
wE-i are heading towards the status of a person who:
- Exercises rights by birthright (natural law).
- Acts of their own free will.
- Interacts on the basis of voluntary agreements.
- Respects others and loves everyone and everything as themselves.

## Transition Process
This transition is a gradual process:
1. **Awareness**: Understanding one's position (Idea = And where am i?).
2. **Digital Emancipation**: Using cryptography to protect privacy.
3. **Economic Autonomy**: Building independence from fiat systems.
4. **Political Subjectivity**: Direct participation in decision-making through decentralized networks.
