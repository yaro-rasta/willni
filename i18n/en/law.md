# Legal Foundation: Correlation of Rights

Analysis of the legal foundations of the new system of free people.

## Roman Law (System Law)
Modern state systems rely on Roman Law, which is a deeply logical construct. This whole world is extremely logical, and Roman Law reflects this logic in the legal plane:
- **Persona**: A human acts as a "persona" (a legal role/mask).
- **Property**: The system claims supremacy over the rights of the individual through logical contracts.
- **Registration**: Logical fixation of the transfer of title to the "persona" to the state.

This defines the status of a person as a system resource within its logic.

## Natural Law
Our network is built on Natural Law, which precedes any statutes:
- **Right to Life**: Life is sacred and inviolable.
- **Right to Will**: A human is born free.
- **Right to Property**: Ownership of the fruits of one's labor is absolute.

## Resolution
The new decentralized network embodies the principles of **Natural Law**:
- **Code is Law**: The code serves as a protection of sovereignty.
- **Sacred Will**: Volunteering for participation is the highest priority.
- **Distributed Justice**: Arbitration is carried out by equals among equals.
- **Will over Law**: A person has the right to their own will which defines the law and respects the will of others and everyone existing.
